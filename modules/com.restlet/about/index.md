# Realize your web APIs

Our goal is to provide software and services that facilitate the
realization of your web API projects. In addition, we want to make the
path from your ideas to their realization as enjoyable and efficient as
possible for all stakeholders, project managers, architects and
developers.

We bring in your hands the power and simplicity of the Web and its
founding principles such as its REST architecture style, its core
standards including HTTP, URIs and HTML.

# Open source roots

Since our creation, we are at the same time big users of open source
software and providers through our Restlet Framework project at the core
of our APISpark cloud platform. We are trying to find the best balance
between the free usage of our software and the need to fund our research
and development and our structure.

We think that the most generic pieces of infrastructure should be freely
usable with as few constraints as possible. For example we distribute
the Restlet Framework under Apache, LGPL, EPL and CDDL licenses,
compatible with most usages.
