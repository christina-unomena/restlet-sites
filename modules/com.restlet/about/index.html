<p>
    Restlet is a web API platform vendor, pioneer of RESTful web APIs. We serve our customers all over 
    the world, providing cutting edge software to build web APIs including APISpark, our disruptive

<@h3 "Realize your web APIs" "realize-your-web-apis">

<p>
    Our goal is to provide software and services that facilitate the realization of your web API projects. 
    In addition, we want to make the path from your ideas to their realization as enjoyable and efficient as 
    possible for all stakeholders, project managers, architects and developers.
</p>

<p>
    We bring in your hands the power and simplicity of the Web and its founding principles such as its 
    REST architecture style, its core standards including HTTP, URIs and HTML.

<@h3 "Open source roots" "open-source-roots">

<p>
    Since our creation, we are at the same time big users of open source software and providers through 
    our Restlet Framework project at the core of our APISpark cloud platform. We are trying to find the 
    best balance between the free usage of our software and the need to fund our research and development 
    and our structure.
</p>
<p>
    We think that the most generic pieces of infrastructure should be freely usable with as few constraints 
    as possible. For example we distribute the Restlet Framework under Apache, LGPL, EPL and CDDL licenses, 
    compatible with most usages.
