   <p>
      Restlet is an Open Source project that is distributed under several licenses at the
      same time. Users can choose one of the following open source licenses:
   </p>

   <ul>
      <li>
         <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache-2.0">Apache license 2.0</a>
      </li>

      </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
      In addition, we want to expressly mention that Restlet S.A.S. is the sole copyright
      holder of the whole source code and has no intention to release future versions of the 
      open source Restlet Framework under more restrictive licences (such as GPL). If we 
      change our licensing policy in the future, it could only be to add less restrictive 
      licenses.
   </p>

   <p>
      The CDDL license is based on the Mozilla Public License used for the Firefox browser. It
      is a flexible license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) encouraging contributions
      back to the project. It is used by Sun Microsystems to distribute its OpenSolaris or
      GlassFish projects. If you have questions about this license, you can
      refer to their <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/about/faq/licensing_faq/">CDDL FAQ</a>.
   </p>

   <p>
      The EPL license was defined by the Eclipse foundation and has properties similar to the
      LPGL and CDDL licenses. If you have questions about this license, you can
      refer to their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php">EPL FAQ</a>.

   <p>
      Licenses for special usages, like embedding in proprietary products without
      the constraint of giving access to the Restlet source code found in the Open
      Source licenses, or commercial usage of the Restlet trademark can also be
