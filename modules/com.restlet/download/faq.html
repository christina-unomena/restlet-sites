    <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/" title="Debian releases">Debian releases </a>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>"Stable"</i> is the release that we recommend for
		applications in production. The API of this release is frozen and only
		bug fixes are made.</li>
	<li><i>"Testing"</i> is the release that we recommend for new
		developments. We are looking for feed-back and contributions regarding
		bugs and missing features.</li>
	<li><i>"Unstable"</i> is the release where active development
		happens. It corresponds to builds of the development trunk passing all
		unit tests.</li>
</ul>
