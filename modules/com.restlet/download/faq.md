# What are the differences between stable, testing and unstable releases?

The Restlet Framework is available under three versions, tagged like
[Debian releases](http://www.debian.org/releases/ "Debian releases"):

-   *"Stable"* is the release that we recommend for applications in
    production. The API of this release is frozen and only bug fixes are
    made.
-   *"Testing"* is the release that we recommend for new developments.
    We are looking for feed-back and contributions regarding bugs and
    missing features.
-   *"Unstable"* is the release where active development happens. It
    corresponds to builds of the development trunk passing all unit
    tests.
