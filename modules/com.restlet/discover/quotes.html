					<strong>‘The Restlet library was useful in providing
						structure to the project</strong> and helped me to conceive the underlying
					objects and concepts as a set of resources which could be exposed
					and combined in various ways, as well as providing a reliable
					implementation to coordinate the resources in a distributed
					system.’

					<strong>‘Restlet really has been wonderful to work with on
						this project and has greatly eased and sped development.</strong> I'm
					looking forward to finding other projects where it would be
					well-suited!... Restlet is amongst the most interesting and
					exciting projects I'm aware of in the Java world currently and I
					would be delighted to recommend it to anyone.’

					<strong>‘Restlets are a joy to code, and the code base is
						easy to understand</strong> once you see a few Restlets coded. Albert
					Einstein said, 'Everything should be made as simple as possible,
					but not simpler.' I hope you agree with me that the Restlet
					framework and REST itself exemplify this mantra's wisdom.’

					<strong>‘We're happy campers with the server side
						capabilities Restlet provides us;</strong> particularly the dynamic ability
					to define and register resources has set this apart from other (to
					remain unnamed) frameworks we used. This is crucial in the
					declarative and pluggable environment we have.’
