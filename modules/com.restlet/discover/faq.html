      Note that there is <a href="/documentation/${ant["stable.restlet-version-minor"]}/faq">another FAQ</a> covering
      more specific questions about the current version of the framework.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="01"></a>1. Why do I need a framework for REST?</h4>

   <p>
      The goal of a framework is to provide a reusable and extendable
      set of classes and interfaces that will serve as a foundation on which
      you can construct your own applications more efficiently. The Restlet
      project was started from the observation that no Java framework was
      available to help developers build RESTful applications.
   </p>

   <p>
      First, it's important that you familiarize yourself with the <a
         href="#04">REST architecture style</a>. Then you will realize that the
      Restlet API derived the name of its classes directly from the REST
      concepts (resource, representation, connector, component, media type,
      language, etc.). This means that you are able to think RESTfully and to
      translate your solution into code more naturally.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you are not familiar with REST yet, you still gain the protocol
      abstraction provided by Restlet: the same API is usable for multiple 
      protocols (HTTP server, HTTP client, SMTP client, JDBC
      client, file system...). For example, you don't need to know the HTTP
      headers to do content negotiation (see <a href="/learn/guide/2.1/core/http-headers-mapping">
      mapping table</a>). Also, you don't need to use and learn
      multiple APIs (Servlet, HttpUrlConnection and JavaMail for example) to
      implement standard Web applications.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="02"></a>2. What are the underlying concepts?</h4>

   <p>
      As the name of the project implies, the Restlet class is an essential concept
      to understand. It extends a RESTful Uniform class and serves as the basis for
      connectors, components, applications, finders,
      etc. It contains a single "public void handle(Request request,
      Response)" method which is the contract respected by all parts of the
      framework.
   </p>

   <p>
      Then, the Request and Response classes are important as they encapsulate
      all aspects of a RESTful call, in a protocol neutral way. All REST
      concepts were implemented, trying to use the REST name as the name of
      the equivalent Java interface. Some specialized Restlets like
      Application, Filter, Finder, Router and Route were added to facilitate
      the processing of calls with URI-based routing or target resource
      identification.
   </p>

   <p>
      The processing of REST calls is typically done in two phases. During the
      first one, the call is processed by a chain of Restlets in order to
      filter it (like for security purpose or to extract variables from URI
      parts) to a locate a the target Resource of the call, as identified by
      the URI. The Finder class is the last Restlet in the processing chain,
      responsible to actually find a Resource instance based on the processed
      request information. Once this phase is over, the actual processing can
      take place in the target Resource class, or more likely one of its
      subclasses that you will have created. The concepts of Resource and
      Representation are really central to REST and therefore to the Restlet
      API. A single Resource can expose several Representations, in different
      formats, languages, etc. In order to help you return the best
      Representation of your Resources, an automatic and transparent content
      negotiation algorithm is used.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="03"></a>3. What are the advantages of using Restlets instead of Servlets?</h4>

   <p>
      There are many advantages, but the main one is that Restlet
      strictly follows the REST architecture style as defined by Roy T.
      Fielding, co-author of the HTTP protocol. This ensures that your
      application can easily be developed in a RESTful manner. Each concept of
      REST has a corresponding Java class in the Restlet API. Also, Restlet
      removed the concepts of in-memory user sessions which are not RESTful
      and are a major bottleneck for availability and scalability of Servlet
      applications.
   </p>

   <p>
      Another advantage is the ability to work with multiple protocols (HTTP,
      JDBC, SMTP, etc.) using the exact same API. This is true for both
      client-side and server-side application. In addition, a Restlet
      Application can be a client and a server at the same time. It's a truly
      Web centric framework. If you compare it to the Servlet API, it's an
      HTTP-only API with support for server-side code. To do client-side code,
      you need to rely on the low-level HttpURLConnection class from the JDK
      which uses a completely different API or on the Apache HTTP Client
      project.
   </p>

   <p>
      Also, the Restlet API is cleanly separating the low-level protocol
      aspects from the application aspects. For most applications, you won't
      need access to HTTP headers to get the media type of a request, you
      just use request.getEntity().getMediaType(). This separation enables the
      automatic support of server-side content negotiation, and allows protocol
      connectors to implement any optimization they need without interfering
      with the application code. With Servlets, everything is mixed as
      applications can directly modify the HTTP headers and take control of
      the output stream.
   </p>

   <p>
      In addition, via the use of Routers and Routes, the Restlet API gives
      full control of the call handling to developers. In the Servlet world,
      the standard approach is to configure the URI mappings in the
      configuration file of the component, which is not as flexible. There is
      always the possibility to manually handle the dispatching or to rely on
      third-party frameworks like Struts or Spring, but it is really not as
      convenient and powerful as the integrated support provided by the
      Restlet API.
   </p>

   <p>
      Finally, the Restlet API is I/O agnostic as its core Representation
      interface can work equally well with BIO streams (java.io package) and
      NIO channels (java.nio package). This brings the potential of
      significant performance boosts when fully NIO compliant connectors will
      become available. The main advantage will be the increased scalability by
      removing the need to associate one thread for each opened connection
      which is a major bottleneck in current Servlet containers.
   </p>

   <p>
      For those who need to leverage existing Servlet containers or to integrate
      with larger Servlet applications, there is a light adapter available to
      let you use the Restlet API as a third-party Servlet library.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="05"></a>5. How do you compare to Ruby on Rails?</h4>

   <p>
      It is always hard to make fair comparisons, especially when you are from one
      side and when you don't have an intimate knowledge of the other side. Our general
      feeling is that Rails was not built with REST principles at its core. Those
      principles were rather retrofitted in version 2.0. Also, the new support for REST
      comes with many constraints on the database schema and on the URI namespace.
   </p>

   <p>
      On the other hand, the Restlet project was explicitly built with REST concepts in
      mind and has natural support for major features such as transparent content
      negotiation or automatic support of PUT/DELETE methods when exposing a directory
      (aka mini-WebDAV mode). Also, you are free to choose any persistence solution for
      your resources.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="06"></a>6. How do you compare to Django?</h4>

   <p>
      Again, it is always hard to make fair comparisons, especially when you are from one
      side and when you don't have an intimate knowledge of the other side. Our general
      feeling is that django was not built with REST principles at its core. The project
      hasn't reach the final 1.0 version yet, but so far there doesn't appear to be any
      specific REST support even though, as a generic Web framework django can perfectly
      be used to build RESTful applications.
   </p>

   <p>
      For example, django doesn't support URI templates natively, you need to manually
      convert them to Regex expressions. Also, if you want to enable HTTP caching or
      authentication, you have to manually set the "Last-modified" or "WWW-Authenticate"
      headers. Like many similar frameworks, it is assumed that you are using a RDBMS to
      persist your resources which is not the only solution nor the best.
   </p>

      (aka mini-WebDAV mode). Also, you are free to choose any persistence solution for
      your resources.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="07"></a>7. What is the link between Restlet and JAX-RS (JSR-311)?</h4>

   <p>
      Restlet is an open source project that provides a complete RESTful framework. When it
      was launched in 2005, it was the very first framework specifically designed with REST 
      in mind (hence its name). It has its own "Restlet API" which is class-oriented, both 
      client-side and server-side, multi-protocol and with a very broad 
      <a href="/about/features">features scope</a>. It also has an implementation (Restlet Engine) 
      and a comprehensive set of extension modules. Restlet has even been
      ported to GWT 1.5 so you can use it right from your browser, without any plugin!
   </p>
   
   <p>      
      On the other hand, the JAX-RS API (draft state only) is result of the ongoing work 
      of an Expert Group also known as the JSR-311 EG. This effort was initiated and is led 
      by Sun Microsystems, based on an earlier prototype that was part of 
      <a href="http://developers.sun.com/docs/web/swdp/r1/tutorial/doc/p33.html">
      Sun Web Developer Pack (SWDP) r1</a> released in 2007. The goal is to produce an API
      which is annotation-oriented, server-side only and focused on the HTTP protocol. 
      The reference implementation produced by Sun is called Jersey.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      To summarize, both APIs have very different designs but are potentially complementary.
      The good news is that J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Louvel (Restlet's creator) is an active member
      of the JSR-311 Expert Group and that an implementation of the JAX-RS API was made on 
      top of the Restlet API. This "JAX-RS extension for Restlet" was developed by Stephan 
      Koops in the context of his Master thesis and is one of the most advanced implementations 
      available. For more documentation on this extension, please refer to 
      <a href="/learn/guide/2.1/extensions/jax-rs">
      this page</a>. 
   </p>
   
   <h4><a name="08"></a>8. Is there an ECCN(Export Control Classification Number) for Restlet ?</h4>

   <p>
      No official ECCN number is available for the Restlet Framework though it does include 
      encryption technology. First, there is a cryptographic extension (<a href="javadocs://jee/ext/org/restlet/ext/crypto/package-summary.html">org.restlet.ext.crypto</a>) 
      that includes features based on regular Java Cryptography APIs (javax.crypto) and is used 
      for authentication purpose so far. In addition, we can take advantage of the SSL technology 
      to encrypt communications in HTTPS, SMTPS and so on. For further details, please
