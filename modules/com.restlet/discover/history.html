   <h4><a name="history"></a>A bit of history</h4>

   <p>
     The Web and Java have a long history in common already. Since its
      creation in 1994, Java includes the <a
     href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/package-summary.html">java.net
      package</a> and in particular a HTTP client via the <a
      href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html">HttpURLConnection</a>
      class. At that time, Applets were a popular technology running in Web
      browsers that needed a way to call back their origin Web server. Using a
      HTTP client was a good way to do this, limiting the security issues with
      firewalls.
   </p>

   <p>
      Later, around 1998, the <a
      href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/servlet/http/package-summary.html">Servlet
      API</a> was introduced as a way to generate dynamic content on HTTP servers.
      It basically tries to represent a HTTP request/response cycle in an
      object-oriented model. Along with <a
      href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/servlet/jsp/package-summary.html">Java
      Server Pages (JSP)</a>, its sister specification, it became part of a large
      effort to bring Java technologies inside the enterprise. In those applications,
      developers adopt the common object-oriented MVC (Model-View-Controller)
      design pattern, also known as the "<a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_2">Model 2</a>"" approach. In
      this model, Servlets are acting as controllers, JSP pages as views and
      JavaBeans objects as models.
   </p>

   <p>
       At the same period, the <a
       href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> standard emerged from a
       W3C working group. Along with related XSLT, XSL-FO and XPath specifications,
       it provided a new way to generate dynamic pages competing with Servlets
       and JSP pages. The reaction was to embrace XML all over the Java
       platform and JSP evolved to be able to generate XML documents. Another
       path was followed by <a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/">Stefano
       Mazzocchi</a> who
       started <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Apache
       Cocoon</a>, an XML publishing framework built around the concepts of
       separation of concerns and component-oriented design.
   </p>

   <p>
      In 2000, the <a href="http://struts.apache.org/1.x/index.html">Struts</a>
      project defined standard controllers, called Actions, following the
      existing Model2/MVC pattern. Application state is exchanged between the
      model and the view using ActionForms. It quickly became successful as it
      provided a higher level of abstraction than pure Servlets, especially
      for forms handling. Later, numerous other frameworks appeared to address
      similar problems. The most notable is <a
       href="http://spring.io/">Spring</a> which is a more
      comprehensive Java/J2EE application framework than Struts, also
      implementing the <a
       href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/mvc.html">MVC
      approach</a>.
   </p>

   <p>
      The same year, <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/">Roy
      T. Fielding</a>, who co-authored the <a
       href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP</a> &amp; <a
       href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">URI</a>
      specifications and was a core contributor the <a
       href="http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html">Apache HTTP server</a>, wrote a <a

       href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">dissertation
      on software architectures</a>. In the <a
       href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">chapter
      5</a> he formally defined the architecture style supporting the Web and
      called it <a
       href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>,
      for REpresentational State Transfer. It defines a new paradigm that
      could be called resource-orientation, in comparison to
      object-orientation, where resources represent identifiable concepts of
      your domain (comparable to objects). The resources are referenced using
      the standard URIs (URLs or URNs) and manipulated by components
      (browsers, servers, proxies, gateways, etc.) through a uniform
      interface. This interface has a limited list of verbs, essentially the <a

       href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9">HTTP
      methods</a>. Also, resources are never exchanged directly, only
      representations of their state are. Connectors are the architecture
      elements that enable the communication of representations between
      components, implementing for example the client-side of the HTTP
      protocol.

   <h4><a name="servlet"></a>Servlet limitations</h4>

   <p>
      At the end of 2003, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/gregwilkins">Greg Wilkins</a>, the author
      of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Eclipse Jetty</a> and contributor to the
      <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=154">Servlet specifications</a>,
      <a href="https://webtide.intalio.com/2003/12/servlets-must-die-slowly/">blogged</a>
      about some issues with Servlets:
   </p>

   <ul>
      <li>No clear separation between the protocol concerns and the application concerns.</li>
      <li>Unable to take full advantage of the non-blocking NIO due to blocking IO assumptions.</li>
      <li>Full Servlet Web containers are overkill for many applications.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
      He proposed to specify a new API that would be truly
      protocol-independent and define contentlets to expose content and its
      metadata. These ideas were both thought-provoking and inspiring for the
      creation of the Restlet project. In a
      <a href="https://webtide.intalio.com/2004/02/nio-and-the-servlet-api/">later
      post</a>, Greg Wilkins explains with detailed arguments why the current Servlet
      API, without a concept like contentlets, limits the efficient usage of
      the non-blocking NIO API. This traditionally imposes the use of a
      separate thread for each HTTP requests to handle. He goes even further
      in <a href="https://webtide.intalio.com/2004/09/next-generation-jetty-and-servlets/">this
      post</a>, specifying the next generation of Servlets.
   </p>

   <p>
      Another major issue is that the API encourages application
      developers to store session state directly in memory, at the
      application or user session level. Even though it looks like a nice
      feature, it became a major issue for the scalability and
      high-availability of Servlet containers. To compensate, complex
      load-balancing, session replication and persistence mechanisms must be
      implemented. But in the end, scalability inevitably suffers.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="inception"></a>Restlet inception</h4>

   <p>
      As I started the development of a new Web site, I wanted to
      comply with the REST architectural style as much as technically
      possible. After many researches, I noted the lack of a REST framework in
      Java. The only project that came close to it was <a
         href="http://www.1060.org">1060 NetKernel</a> developed by <a
         href="http://www.1060research.com/">1060 Research</a> but
      it had too many features for my needs and I found that the mapping of
      REST concepts was not as direct as I was expecting.
   </p>

   <p>
      This led me to develop my own REST framework on top of the
      Servlet API. This worked well up to a point were the Servlet API was
      completely hidden. I remembered about Greg Wilkins's propositions and
      decided to completely bypass the Servlet API. Fortunately, Jetty has a
      nice separation between its HTTP protocol implementation and its support
      for the Servlet API. In the end, I was able to develop the first Restlet
      connector, a HTTP server connector, directly issuing REST uniform calls.
   </p>

   <p>
      Also, I wanted to get rid of the unnatural separation between the
      client-side and server-side view of the Web in Java, following the sound
      advice of Benjamin Carlyle in this <a
       href="http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2005/11/12/#httpAPI">blog
      post</a>. In today's networked environment, we shouldn't have to make such
      differences; anybody should be able to act, at the same time, as a Web
      client and as a Web server. In REST, every component can have as many
      client and server connectors as needed, so I simply developed a client
      HTTP connector based on the HttpURLConnection class mentioned above. Of
      course, other implementations could be provided, like the one based on
      the <a
       href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">Jakarta
      Commons HTTP Client</a> that was recently added.
   </p>

   <p>
      After several iterations, it became clear that it would be
      beneficial for developers to separate the Restlet project into two parts.
      The first part is a generic set of classes, called the Restlet API,
      including a few helper classes and a mechanism to register a Restlet
      implementation. The second part is a reference implementation, called
      the Restlet Engine, including several server and client
      connectors (HTTP, JDBC, SMTP, etc.), a set of representations (based on
      strings, files, XML documents, templates, streams, etc.) and a Directory
      able to serve static files from a tree of directories with automatic content
      negotiation based on file extensions. Since the first public release in
      November 2005, the project keeps maturing thanks to the help of an active
      community of users and developers.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4>

   <p>
      While powerful for complex centralized models, the
      object-oriented paradigm isn't always the best suited for Web
      development. Java developers need realize this and start thinking more
      RESTfully when developing new Web servers or new AJAX-based Web
      clients. The Restlet project is providing a simple yet solid foundation
      that can get you started right away on the Web 2.0.
