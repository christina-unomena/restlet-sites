<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>
	As an open source project, we think that openness goes beyond giving
	access to our source code. Therefore we have attempted to describe our
	governance policy below. We are open to your suggestions, so feel free
	to comment here or on our <a
		href="http://restlet.com/participate/">mailing list</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="roles">Roles</h4>

</p>
<h5 id="contributor">Contributor</h5>
<p>
	We have a very broad definition of this role. For us, each person who
	directly contributes by feed-back, bug report, feature or enhancement
	suggestion, documentation writing, code or patch contribution receives
	the <strong>contributor</strong> title. We attempt to maintain a
	complete list on <a
		href="http://restlet.com/participate/team#contributors">this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Persons who want to contribute source code to the Restlet project are
	all required to sign our JCA (Joint Copyright Assignment). For
	instructions and details, please consult <a

	Restlet extension with committer rights on the extension source code.

		href="http://restlet.com/participate/team#extension-committers">this
		page</a>.

	<strong>project owner</strong> under the responsibility of the <strong>technical
