APISpark proposes 2 types of Data Stores: 

* local Data Stores for which data is hosted / backuped and operated by APISpark teams and 
* wrapped stores for which data are hosted externally (SQL Wrapper, Google spread Sheet Wrapper)...

We distinguish 2 types of local Data Stores: 

* Entity Stores (structured data)
* File Stores (static files)


An Entity Store allows you to store structured data (equivalent to a database). You start by creating Entities and you can express relations between Entities.
