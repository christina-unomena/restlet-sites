You can map relations between an Entity Property and another Entity.
For example, you can create a “Contact” Entity and an “Address” Entity and create a relation between the “address” property of the “Contact” Entity and the “Address” Entity.

1. Create an Entity called “Contact” and add 4 properties: “name, “surname”, “address” and “phone”.
2. Create another Entity called “Address” and create 4 properties: “line1”, “line2”, “zipCode”, “city” and “country”.
3. Select the “Contact” Entity in the **Entities** section.
4. In the **Overview** tab, click on your “address” property.
5. In the **Datatype** drop-down menu, select “address” (the “address” entity).
