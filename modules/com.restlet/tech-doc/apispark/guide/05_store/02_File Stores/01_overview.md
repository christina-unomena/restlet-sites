APISpark proposes 2 types of Data Stores: 

- local Data Stores for which data is hosted / backuped and operated by APISpark teams and 
- wrapped stores for which data are hosted externally (SQL Wrapper, Google spreadsheet Wrapper)...

We distinguish 2 types of local Data Stores:
 
- Entity Stores (structured data)
- File Stores (static files)

A File Store allows you to store static files (text documents, images, videos or style sheets).
