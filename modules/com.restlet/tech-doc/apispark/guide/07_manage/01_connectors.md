An API connector is composed of:

 * an API configuration controlled by APISpark Console
 * a Remote Agent running that retrieves the configuration from APISpark, manages the actual/raw API and sends back usage data to APISpark
the actual “raw” API that is hosted by our customer and provides the actual service

The first section is actually giving read-only information (including the “Usage mode” and “IP address”) about the Remote Agent
I think we need to adjust the section title accordingly, maybe “Remote Agent Details” or just “Remote Agent”

The second section is actually giving control on which overall API management features are provided to the actual/raw API by the Connector
I think we need to adjust the section title accordingly, maybe “API Management Features” or just “Features”
