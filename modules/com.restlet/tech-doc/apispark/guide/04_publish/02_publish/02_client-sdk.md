The beauty of a RESTful API is that it can easily be invoked by a host of different devices and applications.

To facilitate this, APISpark can generate custom client SDKs (Software Development Kits) for your web APIs for a number of different environments:

- Java
- Android
- GWT
- JavaScript (AJAX or Node.js)
- IOS

To download a client SDK for a web API:

1. Select the appropriate API.
2. Click on the **Downloads** tab.
3. Select the language you need (Java or JavaScript) in the **Client kits** section.
4. Select the **Type** you need (Java, iOs, JavaScript, ...).
5. Click on the **Download** button.
