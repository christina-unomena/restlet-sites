When you are satisfied with your API, you are almost ready to publish it so that it can be invoked by your customers, internal teams and partners.  
The last step is to customize the invocation rights to your web API.  
APISpark allows you to define invocation rights on each method of your web API Resources. 

Create web API user groups and affect your users to these groups:

1. Open your API.
2. Click on the **Members** tab.
3. In the **Groups** section, click on the **Add** button.
