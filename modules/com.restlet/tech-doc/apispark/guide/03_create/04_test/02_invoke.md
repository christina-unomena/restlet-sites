#Invoke a Web API
As a member of the API core team (as an API team provider), you are given API credentials (login / access token). These credentials are accessible from APISpark. You can invoke an API from any web browser or you can use tools such as Chrome extension POSTMAN to obtain a more visual representation of your API (see Invoke a WebAPI with POSTMAN).

##Find credentials to invoke an API
1. From your **Dashboard**, open the appropriate API.
2. In the **Endpoints** section of the **Overview** tab, select the appropriate endpoint. The credentials display in the right part of the screen.
> **Note:** To invoke an API, you will need to copy the **Endpoint URI**, **Login** and **Password**.
