Essentially, an API is a collection of URIs, HTTP calls to those URIs and some representations of resources. APISpark offers 3 different representation types: XML, JSON or YAML.  
On APISpark console, you can find the representations of your API endpoint resource in the **Overview** tab.  
Click on the appropriate endpoint and the appropriate resource in the **Representations** section. The representations available for the resource selected display in the **Representations** section.
