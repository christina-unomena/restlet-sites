# Endpoint basics

An **Endpoint** is the entry point for accessing a web API.

An **Endpoint** consists of an address or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

A single API can have multiple endpoints, for example to respect different naming conventions or to support different protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS.

To edit a Web API's endpoints in APISpark, navigate to the Web API's **Overview**. The API's endpoints are listed in the **Endpoints** section in the left panel.

You will be prompted to select a **Domain** and a **Protocol** for you new **Endpoint**.

# Custom domains
