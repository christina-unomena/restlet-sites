#Roles

We can distinguish two teams among APISpark stakeholders: the APISpark provider team and the APISpark user team. APISpark providers can also invoke cells as users if they are part of a user group.
APISpark lets you define how members of provider teams interact one with another. Provider team members can add members and grant roles to members. Giving a member either of the Manager, Developer, Operator or User roles will determine that memberâ€™s rights on the cell chosen in the web console. Roles and rights are defined at the cell level.

By default, APISpark proposes 6 roles. Each functional role gives specific permissions on cells in the APISpark console.

##APISpark provider team

 * **Owner:** an owner owns the cell and has full rights on it. An owner can switch between all roles. Each cell has a unique owner (and thus all cell versions have the same owner) that cannot be changed. An owner has specific permissions like copying the cell, deleting it, adding new version, etc.

 * **Manager:** a manager has near-full rights on the cell (but cannot delete it). A manager can switch between 2 roles (Manager or User).

 * **Operator:** an operator has runtime management rights as well as rights on lifecycle aspects of the cell and community management.

 * **Developer:** a developer has rights to design time and development aspects of the cell. A developer can switch between 2 roles (Developer or User).


##APISpark user team

 * **User:** a user can consult basic information about a Web API and be given runtime access rights. A user has no ability to switch to another role.

 * **Guest:** a guest can consult public information about a WebAPI.
If the cell is public, the person with this role can view the cell overview and ask to become a member (needs an APISpark account first). If the cell is private, he should not even know it exists. A guest has no ability to switch to another role.
