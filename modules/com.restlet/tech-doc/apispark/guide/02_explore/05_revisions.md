A revision stands for a minor version (e.g. version v1; revision v1.1). Revisions apply for APIs only (not data stores). You can thus restore a Web API revision from the Revision History panel and browse through the Revision History.
For each revision deployed, the following information is available: creation date (automatically generated - it cannot be updated), author, version (cell to which the revision is attached).

To restore a revision:  

1. Open the appropriate API.  
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.  
3. In the **General** section, select **Revision History**.  
4. Choose the revision you want to restore among the revisions displayed and click the **Restore** button.
