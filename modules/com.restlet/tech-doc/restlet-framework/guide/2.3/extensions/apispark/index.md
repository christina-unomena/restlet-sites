APISpark extension
==================

The APISpark extension provides several tools that can we used either in standalone mode within Restlet Framework or integrated with the APISpark PaaS to enable additional features.

* [Introspector](introspector.md) , a tool to extract the web API definition of your Restlet API or JAX-RS API application and import it in [APISpark](https://apispark.com/) to provide documentation and tooling.

* [Firewall](firewall.md), a service that adds rate limitation to your web API.
