Essentially, an API is a collection of URIs, HTTP calls to those URIs and some representations of resources. Restlet Studio offers 3 different representation types: XML, JSON or YAML.
  
On Restlet Studio, you can find the representations of your API endpoint resource in the **Representations** section.
