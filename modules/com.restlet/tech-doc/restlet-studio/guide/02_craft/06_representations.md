Essentially, an API is a collection of URIs, HTTP calls to those URIs and some representations of resources. Restlet Studio offers 3 different representation types: XML, JSON or YAML.  
On Restlet Studio, you can find the representations of your API endpoint resource in the **Representations** section.  
Click on the appropriate endpoint and the appropriate resource in the **Representations** section. The representations available for the resource selected display in the **Representations** section.

Several variants of a representation can be expressed to support content negotiation between several media types such as JSON, YAML or XML.
