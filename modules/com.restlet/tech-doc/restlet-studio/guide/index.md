**Restlet Studio** provides a web console that lets you visually craft web APIs. No need to learn Swagger or RAML syntaxes in JSON or YAML to get started, Restlet Studio generates them for you in addition to server skeletons to bootstrap your API implementation and client SDKs to facilitate the consumption of your API.
