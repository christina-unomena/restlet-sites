RDF extension
=============

Introduction
============

This extension provides supports for the core standard of the Semantic
Web: the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It support all major RDF
serialization formats (n3, Turtle, NTriples and RDF/XML) and can work in
either a DOM-like or SAX-like way, with a unified API!

For additional details, please consult the
[Javadocs](javadocs://jse/ext/org/restlet/ext/rdf/package-summary.html).See
also the [sample
application](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/28-restlet/270-restlet/245-restlet.html "Sample application").
