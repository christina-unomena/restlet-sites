# Getting started

This section explains how to get started with the Restlet Framework,
including set up and debugging tools in common development environments
such as:

-   [Eclipse IDE](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/93-restlet.html "Getting started with Eclipse IDE")
-   [Maven](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/92-restlet.html "Getting started with Maven")
-   [Maven and Spring](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/381-restlet.html "Getting Started with Maven and Spring")
-   [Debugging tools](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/102-restlet.html "Debugging tools")

In addition, we highly recommend that you read these [community tutorials](/participate#/167-restlet.html)
provided by Restlet users in various forms:

-   Detailled article
-   YouTube videos
-   Blog posts

Finally, there is the [Restlet in Action](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193518234X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=193518234X&linkCode=as2&tag=restlet-20)
book written by Restlet creators and published by Manning that is a highly recommended reading for a smoother Restlet learning curve.
