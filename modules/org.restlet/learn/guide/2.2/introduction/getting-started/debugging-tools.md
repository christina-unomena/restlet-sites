# Debugging tools

## Introduction

As a set of pure Java library, the Restlet framework can easily be
debugged in your favorite IDE. All the source code is available, making
debugging session even easier by going inside the Restlet code if
necessary.

A good way to start a debugging session is to put a breakpoint inside
the handle() method or inside the constructor of your Resource subclass.
Think also about turning one the access and application
