            <h3>Easily develop web APIs with APISpark</h3>

            <h4>
                <a id="introduction" name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction
            </h4>

            <p>A web API is a set of resources identified on the Web via URIs
                and exposing operations as standard HTTP methods, as well as a set
                of representations defining the structure of messages exchanged. It
                lets API users work on data in multiple formats such as JSON, XML or
                YAML using the HTTP content negotiation. Web APIs are closely
                related to the concepts of REST, the architectural style of the Web.</p>

            <p>APISpark is a cloud platform (PaaS) to create, host, manage
                and use web APIs by providing an online Integrated Development
                Environment (Web IDE) and a hosting service. It lets you define web
                APIs based on the concepts of REST. Its user interface guides the
                developer to expose data and logic behind resources. The power of
                the tool is in the fact that no line of code is necessary because
                the interaction between web APIs and backends can be configured
                visually.</p>

            <p>
                APISpark is currently available in beta version at <a
                    href="http://apispark.com">http://apispark.com</a>. The following
                figure provides an overview of APISpark.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="219" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-09.png"
                    width="533">
            </p>
            <p>The main benefit of APISpark is its ability to implement
                quickly and easily web APIs for people who do not have the time or
                expertise to obtain the same result by themselves using open source
                and manually coded software. APISpark lets you build a new
                generation of cross-channel websites that can be accessed by any
                type of machine (web browser, native application, computer program,
                connected device and so on).</p>
            <p>APISpark relies on the concept of cell following the metaphor
                of the bee hive. A cell is a basic software package that can
                interact with other imported cells. Three main types of cells are
                available as shown in the following figure.</p>
            <p>
                <img height="406" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-15.png"
                    width="461">
            </p>
            <p>
                The cell type <strong>Custom API</strong> is an API (available web
                business once deployed via HTTP and exposing data). It can rely on
                it for the other two types of cells: the <strong>Entity
                    Store</strong> for structured data (equivalent to a database) and the <strong>File
                    Store</strong> for static files (text documents, images, videos or style
                sheets).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the coming months, new types of cells will be added to connect to
                existing web APIs hosted outside of APISpark (<strong>API
                    wrappers</strong>) and to connecting to existing data stores.
            </p>
            <p>Now that we have introduced APISpark, let&rsquo;s describe a
                concrete example: the implementation and use of a web API managing
                contacts.</p>

            <h4>
                <a id="contacts-api" name="contacts-api"></a>2. Overview of the API
            </h4>
            <p>All through this tutorial, we will illustrate how to develop a
                web API to manage a contacts database. This API offers the
                opportunity to list, create, edit, and delete contacts. APIs in
                APISpark follow the structure described in the following figure.</p>
            <p>
                <img height="327" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-11.png"
                    width="553">
            </p>
            <p>The API contract corresponds to the resources made
                &#8203;&#8203;available to API users. For our API, we define several
                resources to manage our contacts and their associated application
                elements (HTML, CSS, etc.).:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Resource managing the collection of contacts with the path
                    <strong>/contacts/</strong>. It will list the contacts with its GET
                    method and add new ones with the POST method.
                </li>
                <li>Resource management from a particular contact with the path
                    <strong>/contacts/{ contactId}</strong> where {contactId} is a
                    variable and corresponds to the identifier of the contact. It
                    allows you to retrieve a particular contact with the GET method,
                    modify or delete it with its PUT and DELETE methods.
                </li>
                <li>Resource for HTML and CSS files with the paths <strong>/html/{file}</strong>
                    and <strong>/css/{ file}</strong>. It allows you to retrieve the
                    content of the file via GET, to add or modify files with the PUT
                    method or to remove it with DELETE.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first two resources are based on two representations of
                contacts. The first is Contact and contains properties for a single
                contact item, such as the username, full name and age. The second is
                called ContactList and provides a list of contacts based on the
                previous representation. These two representations are used as both
                input and output entities for the resources methods.</p>
            <p>Other representations are also used for directories and static
                files.</p>
            <p>In APISpark, a web API typically delegates calls to other
                cells. In our case, it is the data stores, one for structured data
                (like a database) and one for static files (like an Apache httpd
                server). Let&rsquo;s start with the database.</p>
            <h4>
                <a id="create-database" name="create-database"></a>3. Creating the database
            </h4>
            <p>Web APIs often expose and edit structured information stored
                in a relational or NoSQLdatabase. This is also the case for our
                contacts management API. In APISpark, the cell type providing this
                functionality is called the Entity Store.</p>
            <p>
                Once our entity store is created (named &quot;<strong>Contacts
                    DB</strong>&quot;), we can define a <strong>Contact</strong> entity bringing
                together information related to one contact. An entity is equivalent
                to a table in a relational database. To keep things simple, we will
                define a unique identifier, a last name, a first name and an age.
                The following figure illustrates this in APISpark console.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="369" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-02.png"
                    width="623">
            </p>
            <p>Regarding the properties of the entity, it is possible to
                define whether it is a primary key, the cardinality and data type,
                as shown in the next figure.</p>
            <p>
                <img height="345" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-13.png"
                    width="412">
            </p>
            <p>Another aspect of an entity to consider is its methods.
                Although it is possible to manually define them, default methods are
                automatically added when creating an entity. These methods allow you
                to manage the entity based on CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete).
                The figure below describes these operations in more details.</p>
            <p>
                <img height="198" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-16.png"
                    width="619">
            </p>
            <p>
                Once these elements are defined, simply deploy the Entity Store to
                make it operational and usable by our contacts API. This is done by
                clicking on the Deploy button. It should be noted that <strong>Entity
                    Store</strong> ;is usable only within the APISpark platform. To make its
                data remotely available, it must be exposed by one web API (or
                several!).
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we tackle our web API itself, we will create another type of
                data store, the <strong>File Store</strong> to persist and serve
                some static files.
            </p>
            <h4>
                <a id="create-folders" name="create-folders"></a>4. Creating the file folders
            </h4>
            <p>
                A web API can also expose static files. In the case of our contacts
                API, it includes HTML, JavaScript for AJAX calls and CSS style
                sheets. In APISpark, the cell type that supports this aspect is
                called a <strong>File Store</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>This type of data store is organized as a set of folders, much
                like S3 buckets of Amazon Web Services. Actually, S3 is used
                internally by APISpark to power this feature.</p>
            <p>
                Once our file store is created (named &quot;<strong>Contacts
                    Files</strong>&quot;), we&#39;re going to add two directories <strong>html</strong>
                and <strong>css</strong> respectively for storing web pages / AJAX
                and style sheets. The following figure illustrates this definition
                in the console.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="301" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-07.png"
                    width="625">
            </p>
            <p>
                Like for entities in <strong>EntityStores</strong>, methods are
                automatically added to folders to manage their content. In this
                case, it covers listing files and reading content, modification and
                deletion of files. The figure below describes these operations for
                the HTML folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="195" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-00.png"
                    width="617">
            </p>
            <p>
                Once your folders are defined, simply deploy the <strong>File
                    Store</strong> to make them usable by our contacts API. This is done simply
                by clicking on the <strong>Deploy</strong> button. Like for the <strong>EntityStore</strong>,
                it should be used through a web API (or several) to make its data
                available.
            </p>
            <p>Once the store is deployed, the APISPark console provides a visual browser 
               that allows to list the stored files, to upload or to download them. We 
               will use this browser in order to add some static files to view our contacts 
               in an HTML page using AJAX leveraging jQuery. The following picture shows the
               content of the HTML page. We will also enhance the appearance of the
               page by adding a CSS stylesheet.</p>
            <p>
                <img height="292" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-01.png"
                    width="620">
            </p>
            <p>
                We will now use the <strong>Browser</strong> tab detailing our store
                directory. It lists the stored files and allows to add more via
                uploads. The following figure describes how to upload our files 
                <a href="./files/contacts.html"><strong>contacts.html</strong></a> and 
                <a href="./files/jquery-min.js"><strong>jquery-min.js</strong></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="336" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-04.png"
                    width="621">
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we have defined the backend consisting of two <strong>Data
                    Stores</strong>, we can address its exposure via the web API itself.
            </p>
            <h4>
                <a id="create-webapi" name="create-webapi"></a>5. Creating the web API
            </h4>
            <p>Defining our contact management web API is straightforward
                with APISpark. Indeed, we can take advantage of its ability to
                automatically create resources within a web API to expose dependent
                data stores. Although it may appear abstract at this level, we will
                detail the use of these features in this section.</p>
            <p>
                Having created our web API called <strong>Contacts API</strong>, we
                will import as dependencies both <strong>Data Stores</strong>
                previously created via the <strong>Settings</strong> tab. It should
                be noted that you can attach the cells for which you are defined as
                a member and therefore appear in your dashboard. The following
                figure shows the import of these two stores in the API.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="313" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-12.png"
                    width="621">
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the next step is the generation of API resources to make the
                managed contacts and the static files accessible. To do this, simply
                go to the tab <strong>Resources</strong> of of each imported cell
                and add resources using the corresponding button <strong>Add
                    resources</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="239" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-03.png"
                    width="433">
            </p>
            <p>
                Resources added and associated representations will be displayed, as
                shown in the previous figure on the properties of the <strong>EntityStore</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once this operation is also performed for the <strong>File
                    Store</strong>, different resources and following representations were
                obtained in the web API.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img height="169" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-14.png"
                    width="354">
            </p>
            <p>All of these resources and representations are properly
                implemented and configured to use previously imported cells. It
                should be noted that we have manually removed, from the Overview
                tab, unnecessary resources &quot;/html/&quot; and &quot;/css/&quot;
                as we don&rsquo;t need to list the folders&rsquo; content.</p>
            <p>
                <img height="303" src="/images/tutorials/tutorial1-05.png"
                    width="618">
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see the different resources and representations have been
                added to the section <strong>Resources</strong> and <strong>Representations</strong>.
                Let&rsquo;s look in more detail at the resource with the URI
                &ldquo;/contacts&rdquo;. Its two methods are:

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The GET method to retrieve a list of contacts based on the
                    representations <strong>Contact</strong> and <strong>ContactList</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The POST method to add a new contact using the
                    representation of <strong>Contact.</strong>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As you can see, the methods expose HTTP actions and configure what
                is accepted as request and response entities. Internally, actions
                can be configured to define what is the implementation to execute
                &#8203;&#8203;during the call. In the case of the GET method, the
                action is a call to the entity store, particularly to the SELECT
                method of the <strong>Contact</strong> entity that retrieves the
                list of contacts. This list will be formatted by the <strong>ContactList</strong>
                representation and then returned.
            </p>
            <p>Representations define an exchanged data structure but are not
                tied to a particular format (also known as media type). Indeed,
                APISpark supports content negotiation to use JSON, XML, YAML or
                others. This aspect is configured at the API and representation
                level based on the concepts of extension and variant.</p>
            <p>
                We can now deploy the web API so that it becomes accessible from the
                Internet through the domain <strong>apispark.net</strong>. The full
                address to access the API is based on the subdomain name specified
                during its creation. If the methods are secure resources, you should
                use the username and password to access the properties of the access
                point (API endpoint), as shown in the following figure.

            <p>At this point, we have implemented our contacts management API
                and will now describe how to access and use it via different means.

                Using a web API does not impose any APISpark or even a particular
                programming language. This can even be done from a web browser.
                However to test your API, we recommend the use of tools such as
                RESTClient (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/">http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/</a>)
                or the Chrome extension POSTMAN, providing a graphical user
                interface to perform HTTP calls. The following figure shows the call
                to the contacts API with RESTClient.

            </p>
            <p>
                It is also possible to use HTML, JavaScript and CSS previously
                stored in the File Store. Simply use the URL 
                "http://contactsapi.apispark.net/v1/html/contacts.html" in your browser.
            </p>
            <p>Note that APISpark also provides client SDKs for different
                environments such as Java (Java SE/EE or Android), JavaScript (AJAX
                or Node.js) and Objective-C (iPhone or iPad). More environments will
                be supported in the future.</p>
            <p>Finally, the hosting service automatically collects access
                statistics for your APIs and provides visual reports as illustrated
                in the following figure.</p>

            <p>APISpark is a cloud platform (PaaS) offering a productive web
                IDE to create web APIs and underlying backends, as well as an
                integrated hosting service to make them available on the Internet in
                a flash.</p>
            <p>In this tutorial, we saw how to develop a web API managing
                contacts with APISpark, exposing structured data and static files.
                The platform can be also used for more advanced needs such as
                manually adding and implementing resources, including their exact
                URIs and representations.</p>
            <p>We also saw how to deploy the API, done by clicking on a
                single button. You no longer have to worry about issues such as
                high-availability, security and scalability as it is taken care of
                for you by APISpark. Just remember that the platform is still in
                beta stage at the time of writing.</p>
            <p>We can&rsquo;t describe all the platform features in this
                tutorial, but APISpark also provides a catalog of APIs for the
                discovery and promotion of public APIs. It is also possible to
                follow the APIs as well as the relationships between them, like an
                API social network. APISpark also supports templates to instantly
                create APIs. Finally API contracts can easily shared between
                multiple implementations, based on standard APIs that are
                progressively emerging.</p>
